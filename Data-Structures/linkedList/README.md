# LINKED LIST 
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

# Challenge Summary
create a classes and methods to :
insert a new node.
check if that value is included in the linked list.
return the values in the linked lists as string.
## Challenge Description
- how to pass the value in better way.
- check the Null  .
## Approach & Efficiency

-  create an insert method which add the nodes to your linked list

- create a  method called includes which takes any value 
 and returns a boolean, depending on whether that value exists  as a Node’s value in the  list.
- Define a method called toString which returns a string representing all the values in.
